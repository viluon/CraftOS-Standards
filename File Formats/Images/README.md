# Image File Formats

## Official Recommendations

Rather than creating your own format or using a lesser used/inefficient format, it is recommended to use the following formats based on your needs.

**Images that require both text and colour in each pixel (advanced computers)**: [NitroFingers Text](todo)

**Images that only require 1 colour per pixel**: [Universal Compressed Graphics Format](todo)

## Proposal Requirements

Image file format proposals must follow the [File Format proposal requirements](https://github.com/oeed/CraftOS-Standards/blob/master/File%20Formats/README.md#proposal-requirements).
